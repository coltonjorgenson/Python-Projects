The registrar’s office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has been so impressed with your work so far that they have another task for you.

They want you to return to a previous if statement and add in several checks using and and not statements:

If a student’s credits is not greater or equal to 120, it should print:
"You do not have enough credits to graduate."

If their gpa is not greater or equal to 2.0, it should print:
"Your GPA is not high enough to graduate."

If their credits is not greater than or equal to 120 and their gpa is not greater than or equal to 2.0, it should print:
"You do not meet either requirement to graduate!"

Make sure your return value matches those strings exactly. Capitalization, punctuation, and spaces matter!
